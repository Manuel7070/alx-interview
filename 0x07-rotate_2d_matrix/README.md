# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Project Information
- **Algorithm**
- **Python**
- Weight: 1
- Project will start Jul 15, 2024 6:00 AM, must end by Jul 22, 2024 6:00 AM
- Checker was released at Jul 17, 2024 6:00 AM
- An auto review will be launched at the deadline

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.10)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.8.0)
- You are not allowed to import any module
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Rotate 2D Matrix
Given an `n` x `n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

- Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

## Concepts Needed
1. Matrix Representation in Python
2. In-place Operations
3. Matrix Transposition
4. Reversing Rows in a Matrix
5. Nested Loops
