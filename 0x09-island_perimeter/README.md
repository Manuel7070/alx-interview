# 0x09. Island Perimeter Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an algorithm to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array of integers, where the island cells are marked with 1s and water cells are marked with 0s. You will apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve this geometric problem within a grid context.

## Concepts Needed

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array:** Learn to navigate through rows and columns.
- **Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells:** This includes moving horizontally and vertically in the grid.

### Conditional Logic
- **Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island:** This involves checking if a cell is a boundary cell or adjacent to water.

### Counting Techniques
- **Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter:** Identify and sum the edges forming the perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks:** Identify land cells and calculate their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- **Nested loops for iterating over grid cells:** Use loops to traverse through the 2D array.
- **Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells:** Apply if-statements to determine perimeter contributions.
