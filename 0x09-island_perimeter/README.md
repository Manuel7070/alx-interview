## Project Description

This project, "0. Island Perimeter", requires you to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The main objective is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers.

## Concepts Needed

1. **2D Arrays (Matrices)**
   - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array
   - Navigating through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically)

2. **Conditional Logic**
   - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island

3. **Counting Techniques**
   - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island's perimeter

4. **Problem-Solving Strategies**
   - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter

5. **Python Programming**
   - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells
   - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells

## Resources

- **Python Official Documentation**: Nested Lists
- **GeeksforGeeks Articles**: Python Multi-dimensional Arrays
- **TutorialsPoint**: Python Lists
- **YouTube Tutorials**: Python 2D arrays and lists

## Additional Resources

- Mock Technical Interviews

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7)
- No module imports allowed
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All files must be executable

## Approach

To solve this problem, you'll need to:
1. Iterate over the grid
2. Apply logical operations to identify the perimeter of the island
3. Account for the specific conditions described in the task

This project tests your algorithmic thinking and reinforces your ability to manipulate data structures and apply logical reasoning to solve problems.
